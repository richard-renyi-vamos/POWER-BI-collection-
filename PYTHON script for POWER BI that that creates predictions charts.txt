To create a Python script for Power BI that generates three different prediction charts (high, medium, low) based on a dataset, you can follow these general steps:

Prepare the Dataset: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and loaded into Power BI.

Choose Prediction Model: Select a suitable prediction model based on your data and requirements. For this example, let's use a simple linear regression model. You can replace it with any other model as needed.

Write Python Script: Write a Python script within Power BI using the "Python script" visualization. This script will perform the data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

Here's a sample Python script that demonstrates how to achieve this:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')  # Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with your dataset path

# Preprocess data
# For demonstration, assume 'X' is the feature and 'Y' is the target variable
X = data[['feature_column']]  # Replace 'feature_column' with your feature column name
Y = data['target_column']     # Replace 'target_column' with your target column name

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Create prediction chart for 'high', 'medium', 'low'
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(X_test, Y_test, color='blue', label='Actual')
plt.scatter(X_test, predictions, color='red', label='Predicted')
plt.xlabel('X Axis Label')
plt.ylabel('Y Axis Label')
plt.title('Prediction Chart')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Adjust the Script: Modify the script according to your dataset and prediction requirements. Ensure that you have the necessary Python packages installed (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn).

Integrate with Power BI: Copy and paste this script into the "Python script" visualization in Power BI. Ensure that the necessary data columns are selected in the visualization settings.

Create Visualization: Once the script is integrated, Power BI will generate the prediction chart based on the model's output.

Repeat for Different Predictions: Repeat the process for generating prediction charts for 'high', 'medium', and 'low', adjusting the model and script parameters as necessary.

Remember to save your Power BI file after integrating the Python script. This way, the script will be executed whenever the report is refreshed.
